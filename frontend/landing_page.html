                    <p>Newspaper is quite a powerful tool that circulates information to people. It is one of the greatest means of communication between people and the world. In addition, they are also a great medium of knowledge. We get our daily dose of news from newspapers early in the morning. It is quite a reliable source which gives us information only after thoroughly investigating the information.

                    <p>Magazines offer the feeling of holding something in your hand and reading it which I believe is important to society. The functions of a magazine such as longer stories are important because it allows the reader to obtain a full story instead of a few sentences that may have been printed in a newspaper.
